# Time Keeper

Time Keeper is a Summer of Coding entry made to grow a repertoire of JavaScript libraries as well as gain an understanding of components that update in real time. This project was created using [Angular CLI](https://angular.dev) version 20.0.0, [RxJS](https://rxjs.dev/) version 7.8.3, and ngx-countdown.

## Features

- 12HR Clock
- Stopwatch
- Timer
- Pomodoro timer with 25, 10 and 5 minute intervals

## Running Time Keeper

- To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

- To build the project run:

```bash
ng build
```

This will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the `dist/` directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.

- To execute unit tests with the [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io) test runner, use the following command:

```bash
ng test
```

- For end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:

```bash
ng e2e
```

Angular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default. You can choose one that suits your needs.

## Future Updates

- Full Migration to RxJS
- UI/UX Improvements
- More Color Palletes
